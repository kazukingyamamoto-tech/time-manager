# Time Manager

##Overview
This project aims to visualize how time is spent by measuring activities and recording whether the time is productive or unproductive.

Many existing time management applications measure only selected activities you want to record, such as study and part-time work.
However, this application visualizes the balance between productive activities and hobbies, measuring not only productive time but also unproductive time.

## Features
